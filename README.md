# crud
So, this is CRUD framework. Non-commercial, free of charge, no limitations or restrictions.
- UI is based on React.js app, which is served on AWS S3 (static website hosting)
- UI sends REST requests to AWS API Gateway
- API Gateway sends request to Lambda function fnCrud
- Lambda sends request to DynamoDB table tbCrud

  All the code you see in this repo is free, so you can sale, distribute, use it as is or as part of your beautiful project
  without any restrictions or limitations.

  This is first reincarnation of "Encaps PHP app", built 20+ years ago,
  which many of developers and regular web users found useful and flexible.
  So thank you all for your feedback, I will try to make current version so usefull as it was many years ago.

  Will see. I hope to get your feedback soon.
  And you are welcome to share your ideas.
